# Mobile App Development with React Native

- Web site: https://cs50.github.io/mobile/

This course picks up where Harvard Collegeâ€™s [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) leaves off, transitioning from web development to mobile app development with React Native, a popular open-source framework maintained by Facebook that enables cross-platform native apps using JavaScript without Java or Swift. The course introduces students to modern JavaScript (including ES6 and ES7) as well as to JSX, a JavaScript extension. Through hands-on projects, students gain experience with React and its paradigms, app architecture, and user interfaces. The course culminates in a final project for which students implement an app entirely of their own design.
