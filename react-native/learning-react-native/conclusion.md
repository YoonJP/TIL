## Conclusion

If you've made it this far, congratulations!

We've gone from creating your very first "Hello, World" React Native application all the way up through a complex, fully featured application with total code reuse across iOS and Android. In order to do so, we started by looking at the basic components for React Native, and how to style them. We learned how to work with touch and platform native APIs, like the AsyncStorage and Geolocation APIs. We covered how to debug React Native applications with the developer tools, and how to deploy your applications to real devices. For functionality beyond the standard React Native library, we also saw how to use native Objective-C and Java modules as well as third-party JavaScript libraries using npm. 

You knowledge of JavaScript and React, coupled with the topics we've covered in this book, should enable you to quickly and efficiently write cross-platform mobile applications for Android and iOS. Of course, there's still plenty to learn, and this single book can't cover *all* the things you'll need to know in order to develop mobile applications with React Native. If you get stuck or have questions, reach out the community, whether that's on Stack Overflow (*http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native*) or on IRC (*irc.lc/freenode/reactnative*).

Finally, and most importantly, have fun! I'm looking forward to seeing what you build.
