## Preface

This book is an introduction to React Native, Facebook’s Javascript framework for building mobile applications. Using your existing knowledge of Javascript and React, you’ll be able to build and deploy fully featured mobile applications for both iOS and Android that truly render natively. There are plenty of advantages to working with React Native over traditional means of mobile development without needing to sacrifice the native look and feel.

We’ll start with the basics and work our way up to creating a full-fledged application with 100% code reuse between iOS and Android. In addition to the essentials of the framework, we’ll discuss how to work beyond it, including how to make use of third-party libraries and even how to write your own Java or Objective-C libraries to extend React Native.

If you’re coming to mobile development from the perspective of a frontend software engineer or web developer, this is the book for you. React Native is a pretty amazing thing, and I hope you’re as excited to explore it as I am!

### Prerequisites

This book is not an introduction to React, in general. We'll assume that you have some working knowledge of React. If you're brand new to React, I suggest reading through a tutorial or two before coming back to take the plunge into mobile development. Specifically, you should be familiar with the role of `props` and `state`, the component lifecycle, and how to create React components. 

We'll also be using some modern JavaScript syntax, as well as JSX. If you aren't familiar with these, don't worry; we'll cover JSX in Chapter 2, and modern JavaScript syntax in Appendix A. These features are essentially 1:1 translations of the JavaScript code you're already accustomed to writing. 

This book focuses on using React Native to write iOS and Android applications, though React Native can also be used to write applications targeting Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS. Linux and Windows users can use React Native to develop Android applications, but in order to write iOS applications, you will need to develop on macOS.
